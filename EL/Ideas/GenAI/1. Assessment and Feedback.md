1) Auto-grade answers (coding + essay)

		Key idea is to test the AI capability of grading coding questions and giving partial marks. That is, current auto-grading tools largely depend on unit tests to check if the code works. This means giving partial marks is challenging in situations when the code doesnâ€™t compile or has unimportant errors (extra spaces in the output or calculation errors). We need to devise ways where the ai can analyze the code and give partial marks for cases when unit tests fail. Let me know if this would be interesting to you.
