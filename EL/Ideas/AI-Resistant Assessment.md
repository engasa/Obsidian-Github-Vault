**Redesign Assignments**
- Assignments that are encourage using AI guidance,  but detects if AI is used to solve assignments (not sure how detection works though)
- Assignments -> cannot be solved by AI, or AI easily detected
- Focus on the "Why": Design assignments that prioritize understanding the underlying concepts and problem-solving process. Instead of "Write a function to sort this list," ask "Explain the time and space complexity of different sorting algorithms and justify your choice for this specific scenario.
- **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** Include debugging exercises where students must analyze and fix errors in existing code. AI might generate syntactically correct code, but it struggles with real-world code that contains subtle bugs
- Design problems that require knowledge of classroom discussions, custom libraries, or specific datasets that are hard to replicate using generic AI outputs.

**Process**
- Collaborative Projects: Encourage teamwork where students must explain their reasoning and code choices to each other. This makes it harder to simply copy-paste AI-generated solutions
	- Code Reviews and Peer Feedback: Encourage students to review each other's code, looking for both correctness and clarity.
- Live Coding Sessions: Conduct short, timed coding exercises during class. This minimizes the opportunity for AI assistance.
- Oral Presentations and Code Walkthroughs: Have students present their solutions and explain the logic behind their code. This assesses understanding beyond just the final output.

**Make Assignments Process-Oriented:**
- Require students to submit drafts, pseudocode, and progress snapshots alongside the final code.
- Use version control tools (e.g., GitHub) to track their development process.
 
Tools
- **Develop AI Detection Tools:** Explore and utilize AI detection tools (with student awareness) to identify potential instances of AI-generated code.
