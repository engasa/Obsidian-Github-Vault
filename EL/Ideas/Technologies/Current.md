- [ ] Research: 
	- [ ] Parallel Courseware effectiveness (ask engineering students and nonCS to test each objective/benefit - see Parallel Courseware paper)
	- [ ] deploy/test (COSC 111,121 and APSC177) and analyze how the student use the platform.
- [ ] Development: 
	* Connect to Canvas 
	* Instructor level access rights (i.e. who can access what).
	* Motomo test/improvements 
	* UI improvement (Home Screen)
	* Touch screens, reactive, etc.
	* Create a 'textbook' that can be viewed on  tablets/touchscreens. the textbook has the same material and features as the website
- [ ] Content: 
	- [ ] Lesson cover artwork (lesson image)
	- [ ] Add Videos 
	- [ ] Links (replace "link" with an actual link)
	- [ ] Advanced / Beginner
	- [ ] Summary at end of each lesson
	- [ ] Try-it yourself or Python Tutor whereever appropriate (see lessons original html)
	- [ ] badges to modules
	- [ ] More Courses:: Apply for a FUNDING to create another course!!!

<font color="#00b050">Course Planner</font>
* Development: 
	* <font color="#00b050">Planner</font>: generic plan, other degrees, minor/major
	* <font color="#00b050">Scheduler</font>: Workday API: send schedules back to Workday  
	* <font color="#00b050">Transcript</font>: read/integrate
	* <font color="#00b050">Advising</font>: read from reddit etc, test AI, use Llama
	* General: 
		* Error Handling/Boundaries
* Research: 
	* deploy and test
	* *Optimizers: Course plans + schedules
		- [ ] Connect UI to Optimization 
	    - [ ] Gabriella's bug from before (when optimization more than once)
		    - [ ] Screen freeze when: optimize->accept changes ->lock a course 121 ->  optimize again -> accept -> Index 0 out of bounds for length 

<font color="#00b050">NuTeach</font> 
- Connect Canvas
- deploy/test

<font color="#00b050">TA Allocator</font>
* Java -> Web
* Alternative Solutions (instead of one optimal sol)
- Sensitivity analysis.
* Specific Features
	- [ ] Add Gui with stats/info about TAs/CoursesToSched/etc. (maybe top bar?)
	- [ ] TA reasoning for not being able to TA a section
	- [ ] more error handling?
	- [ ] what if csv headers changed? use enum? settings? etc? e.g. enum SEC_TYPE=settings.getSecTypeHeader(); then used SEC_TYPE everywhere.
	- [ ] toOptimize option for courses/labs: UI and model
	- [ ] mustMarkOwnlab option per course (now implemented as an attribute in Courses) + UI
