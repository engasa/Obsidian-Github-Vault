### 1. Generative AI in CS Education
 - **Learning Support**
	- GenAI as tutor
	- GenAI as advisor (courses, other aspects + RAG models)
- **Enhanced Assessment and Feedback**
	- GenAI as an exam grader (essays, code)
 - **Studies:** 
	- SWOT analysis + Academic integrity 
- Machine-learning for adaptive learning environments
- Computer Vision to detect and boost student engagement, and provide targeted support

- #### TODOs + Ideas
	- **Learning Support**
		- ***~ AI as Collaborative Learning Tool*** (team coordination, conflict resolution, intelligent scaffolding (breaking complex tasks into smaller steps) )
		- **Real-Time Teaching Support**: Study how AI can assist instructors during lectures by dynamically generating visual aids, examples, or explanations based on student questions.
		- Personalized learning (dynamically adjust curriculum based on students real-time performance and learning style + personalized feedback) 
	- **Assessment and Feedback:**
		- **~ Explore the use of GenAI to 1) auto-grade assignments+ feedback, 2) identify *common misconceptions*.**
		- **AI-Resistant Assessment Design**: Explore novel assessment methods that reduce the risk of AI-generated plagiarism while encouraging authentic student work
		- **Rubric Generation and Standardization**: Research how Generative AI can standardize and streamline rubric creation for more consistent and transparent grading practices.
	- **Ethics, Social Implications, and Responsible AI**
		- **~ AI Literacy:** Investigate how to responsibly involve AI in teaching and learning + critically evaluate AI-generated content 
		- **Ethical Implications of AI Tutors**: Explore the boundaries of replacing human tutors with AI, focusing on the psychological and educational impacts on students.
		- **Student Perceptions of AI in Learning**: longitudinal studies to understand student trust, acceptance, and ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI in their education.
		- **AI and Future of Work:** Explore how AI will impact the future of work in the CS field and how to prepare students for these changes.
	 - **Curriculum Development**
		 - ***~ Code Generation for Learning Examples***: generating coding examples for specific topics + measure its effectiveness in improving conceptual understanding.
		 - **AI-Assisted Curriculum Design**: Examine how AI can assist educators in creating course content (syllabi, lesson plans, module content) that align with Bloom's taxonomy or other frameworks.
		 - **Question Banks and Assessments**: produce diverse question banks for exams, quizzes, and practice problems, ensuring fairness and difficulty calibration.
	 - **EDI + Accessibility**
		 - **AI-Powered Accessibility Tools:** Develop AI-powered tools to make CS education more accessible to students with disabilities.
		 - **AI for Language and Cultural Diversity:** Explore how AI can be used to support students from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
		 - **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)**: Study how AI can create more inclusive learning materials, such as adaptive text, captions, and code explanations for students with disabilities.
### 2. Technology-Enhanced Educational Platforms
- Optimization: 
	- course planning
	- TA allocation
- LearnCoding (parallel courseware, code visualizer, language comparison, etc)
- NuTeach (gamification techniques, Spaced Repetition, etc)
- ULearn (ML for personalized quizzes)
- DataPlayground (gamification for learning data structures)
### 3.  Innovative, Inclusive Pedagogy and Evaluation in Computer Science Education
(used to be named: Innovative Teaching and Evaluation Methods)
* Mixed-ability classes 
* Study on Women in CS
