### 1. Generative AI in CS Education
 - **Learning Support**
	- GenAI as tutor
	- GenAI as advisor (courses, other aspects + RAG models)
- **Enhanced Assessment and Feedback**
	- GenAI as an exam grader (essays, code)
 - **Studies:** 
	- SWOT analysis + Academic integrity 
- Machine-learning for adaptive learning environments
- Computer Vision to detect and boost student engagement, and provide targeted support

- #### TODOs + Ideas
	- **Learning Support**
		- ***~~ AI as Collaborative Learning Tool*** (team coordination, conflict resolution, intelligent scaffolding (breaking complex tasks into smaller steps) )
		- **~~ Real-Time Teaching Support**: Study how AI can assist instructors during lectures by dynamically generating visual aids, examples, or explanations based on student questions.
		- Personalized learning (dynamically adjust curriculum based on students real-time performance and learning style + personalized feedback) 
	- **Assessment and Feedback:**
		- **~~ Explore the use of GenAI to 1) auto-grade assignments+ feedback, 2) identify *common misconceptions*.**
		- **AI-Resistant Assessment Design**: Explore novel assessment methods that reduce the risk of AI-generated plagiarism while encouraging authentic student work
		- **Rubric Generation and Standardization**: Research how Generative AI can standardize and streamline rubric creation for more consistent and transparent grading practices.
	- **Ethics, Social Implications, and Responsible AI**
		- **~~ AI Literacy and Critical Thinking:** Investigate how to teach students to use AI tools responsibly + critically evaluate AI-generated content 
		- **Student Perceptions of AI in Learning**: longitudinal studies to understand student trust, acceptance, and ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI in their education.
		- **AI and Future of Work:** Explore how AI will impact the future of work in the CS field and how to prepare students for these changes.
	 - **EDI + Accessibility**
		 - **AI-Powered Accessibility Tools:** Develop AI-powered tools to make CS education more accessible to students with disabilities.
		 - **AI for Language and Cultural Diversity:** Explore how AI can be used to support students from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
	 - **Curriculum Development**
		 - ***~~ Code Generation for Learning Examples***: generating coding examples for specific topics + measure its effectiveness in improving conceptual understanding.
		 - **AI-Assisted Curriculum Design**: Examine how AI can assist educators in creating course content (syllabi, lesson plans, module content) that align with Bloom's taxonomy.
		 - **Question Banks and Assessments**: produce diverse, high-quality question banks for exams, quizzes, and practice problems, ensuring fairness and difficulty calibration.
