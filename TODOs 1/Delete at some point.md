Thank you for the invite to these discussions. I have to say I was surprised to learn about these separate meetings, especially since we’ve been addressing many important aspects during the meetings I have been holding on Fridays and during our other private meetings. These include not only the technical side, but also key strategic discussions that we sometimes privately discuss afterwards (NuTeach overall design and workflow, deployment plans, our vision for pitching to other universities and recruiting strategic partners, LT Hub integration, and  the research study to confirm the impact of the system).

I completely understand it is important for smaller groups to meet separately, and I have been encouraging this during the Friday meetings. However, when it comes to strategic decisions, I believe it’s critical that we all stay aligned and work together, especially given how closely I have been involved in leading and directing the project as well as my supervisory role from the start.

That said, I am all for keeping to work closely as we move towards establishing the  startup and involving the university.

Instead of Tuesdays, would you both be available for an additional half-hour after our Friday's meetings? This won't be every week; we can start with these additional meetings as needed and then increase the frequency as we approach the startup launch.

we can chat more this friday. Looking forward to continuing our collaboration.
