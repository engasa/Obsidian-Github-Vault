## Samples from others:

* Here is how Irene wrote Program Adivsor:
    My primary service to the university is my role as Program Advisor for Data Science. This role
    amounts to many hours e-mailing and meeting with students to discuss potential pathways
    through the degree, coordinating with Academic Advisors to make the appropriate notes on
    Degree Navigator, as well as informing and creating curriculum changes. As part of the
    Data/Math/Stats curriculum committee, we put forth a significant amount of curriculum changes
    that we expect to see in the 2023/24 academic calendar.

## Apr 2021 - Mar 2022

**Advisor for COSC + DATA:
    - Review and approve COSC graduate applications (67 BSc COSC students + 19 BA COSC = about 5-6 hours as there were some tricky cases)
    - one case, Nathan Nesbeit, took a 3-4 hours (meetings, discussing with associate head, emails) - he wanted to use directed studies to fullfil his DATA minor

**Articulation:
    - several cases 
    -  writing and submitting the program report (Yves helped) - May 5th 4:00PM
    - attending the articulation meeting - May 6, 2021 02:00 PM 
    
**Adhoc COSC curriculum committee:
    - look at curriculum issues that affect the entire program, e.g. how to scale our mandatory capstone course? should we revise our list of mandatory COSC courses? Is anything missing in our program? Are there any BA specific issues? Pat has agreed to chair the committee as the COSC curriculum rep. Considering the committee will send proposal to all of COSC following our standard curriculum process, another 2-3 volunteers should be enough. I expect the committee to meet 1 hr per month (unless the committee decides to meet more often) until the end of the year.

	DETAILS: 
	see c:\Users\abdalmoh\Google Drive\_UBCO\Educational Leadership\Curriculum Committee for CMPS\department-wide curriculum committee\
	* From Yves' meeting minutes: 
	Since the number of COSC/DATA faculty members has and will further increase, John indicated a formal curriculum committee should be created for COSC/DATA. That would make finding meeting times easier. Abdallah would chair the committee since he is already the unit rep for curriculum; Jeff agrees to participate as DATA representative. A request for volunteer will be issued. The new process will mirror the faculty process i.e. trivial changes and clean up will be approved by the committee while significant change like new programs will require a full vote from all COSC/DATA members. Some changes in between will be emailed for information but still be approved by the committee.
	* one more email:
	Dear COSC, DATA and STAT colleagues:I would like to formally announce the creation of the curriculum committee for COSC, DATA and STAT. The committee will consider curriculum proposals related to COSC, DATA, STAT submitted by department members (including members of the committee). For the first 2-year term, the following members have volunteered to serve on the committee: Abdallah Mohamed (Chair), Jeff Andrews, Yong Gao. 	Membership is on a 2-year renewable term. The committee is expected to meet every month unless there is no proposal to consider. (The committee may decide to handle proposals by email without meeting in person.) Like other curriculum committees, the committee may choose to invite proposal proponents to a meeting to discuss the proposal.Effective immediately, any new proposals should go to the committee for approval. Please indicate clearly to Abdallah that this is for the COSC-DATA-STAT committee approval and not a proposal to be submitted to the dean (Abdallah is also the curriculum rep for the full department so he submits proposal to the dean).
