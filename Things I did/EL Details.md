* Undergraduate Computing at UBCO Session** with High School Counselors
	* (June 11, 2024 email from Lindsay Howe, Communication Manager, Deans office: "FoS, in collaboration with SoE, has been allotted a one hour timeslot to discuss/present on computing programs at UBCO (computer engineering, data science, computer science). As someone who teaches first-year computer science, I was wondering if you would be interested in participating in this event with a colleague from SoE, and possibly a student on July 5 from 11am-12pm. You and your SoE colleague would present an overview of options available to undergraduate students in this area (creation of the Powerpoint will not be your responsibility), and then you would be asked questions from the international counsellors, followed by the opportunity to mingle with them in a more casual environment."

(1) Working with student unions 
	COSC111 workshop: CSCU union
	COSC111 workshop (QSCU): Quantitative something union
	COSC121 drop-in centre(CSCU): an open study period in Arts 281 from 2-4 each Tuesday! We can definitely help anyone in the introductory CS courses or in machine architecture, and it'll be open to anyone else as a study environment. .
 
(2) Courses:
 - COSC211, 111, 122: improvements? (new exams (not sure you want to say this), don't remember others but there has to be some improvements)
 - COSC445: new course (state what you have: new slides (not from a textbook) , new assignments, etc
		- what is special? mixed learning strategies (guest lectures, flipped classroom, projects), two-in-one course
		- why did you use clickers in uppper level small class? 
		- impact? very high TEQs; several students chose Comp.Vision for their honors and directed studies. 
 - COSC121: 
	improvements: 	after class assignments (new - say why you believe this is useful), 
					project improved (clearer description, clear marking guide, others?), 
					improved lecture notes for better readability and understandability (esp. Polymorphism (added summary), OOP added graphics and animation, collections (added illustrations to show the process)..

 - Teaching the largest three classes in COSC: COSC111(~200), COSC121(~145), COSC122(~120): total for 6 courses is 640 students/year (this is not an achievement but it is something to note as other profs are 200 or less students per year)

(3) Essential Skills for Your Digital World (June 1-Mar 3) 
	Old name: "Adult-oriented computational thinking program"(name has changed)
	- prepared the curriculum (outlines, activities, etc) and plan with them
	- meeting 1: prepared curriculum outline and learning outcomes, time line, other logistics. 
	- email: feedback on curriculum
	- meeting 2: ??
	- Resources: UBC/Service/Adult-oriented..etc.
	- designed 3 modules out of 6. 
		Feedback from Michelle Lamberson on one of the modules: Abdallah, thank you so much for the excellent module that you put together.  The materials were absolutely bang on what we needed to be able to provide good scaffolding for people to learn the subject matter. I think that may have been our smoothest running module yet!  One person I talked to made the comment that that was the first time she had a chance to systematically work through and understand the basics of Excelâ€¦ she very much enjoyed it!

(4) Redesigned COSC123 almost from scratch 
		- same outcomes, but different structure and language	
		- new lecture notes from scratch (not from the textbook author), new assignments, new in-class activities, etc.
		- used iClicker
		- used flipped-classroom, team-based, or whatever technique you will be using
		- using a new language, Processing, which is based on Java 
			- Why processing? there are several languages and environments that can be used to teach creativity in programming (e.g. Unity, Game Maker)
			- also explained "from Processing to Java" so that this course can be linked to other intro courses related to Java.

		WHY:
		- old design was not made by me. I personally found it well structured and addresses the LOs of the course. However, some things changed which urged me to change the sturcture.
		- class had two student populations: comp-sci and non-comp-sci. there were also some upper-year students who were looking for an easy credit.
		- old design used two languages: Alice and Java. Alice is visual programming. It received both positive comments but also a lot of negative feedback. Why more? comp-sci stduents found the course not challenging enough. Alice, while a good teaching tool, is not an industrial standard. comp-sci students  already knew programming, and hence found Alice part (and early Java parts) not so interesting to them. I was always taking in class surveys to get a sense of what students feel about the content and pace of the course. I tried to overcame this problem by switching fast to the new stuff which most of the students liked.
		-COSC123 is now part of the new BMS program. 

(5) Supervised 2 honours-thesis students and 3 directed-studies students. 
	  - Sam Hunt 
			- Long-Term Course Planning for UBCO students in COSC
			- results are publishable
	  - 445 was so successful that several students worked in honors on related topics
	  
	  
(*) INcluding LearnCoding in APSC177 Engineering:
	I had a discussion with Anas to use LearnCoding for C++ assignments instead of Vocareum. We agreed to do a bonus assignment on LearnCoding starting from next year 2024. The plan is, if it works, then more assignments and exams will be shifted to LearnCoding

	Then, Pat and Yves discuss the new Computer Engineering program with Anas. The result is, we want to use APSC177 as an alternative prereq to COSC121 (in addition to COSC111,123). To make sure APSC177 students have had some exposure to Java before joining COSC 121, they were suggested to use LearnCoding for switching. The following is the added paragraph to the APSC177 syllabus:
	Optional:
		Additional learning material will be accessible through a learning management system called LearnCoding, facilitated by the Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science, Department of Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and Statistics. The additional material will enable students to practice coding in C++ and Java. Students who complete the optional assessments on LearnCoding will receive 2% bonus marks.
			Important: Students who plan to select the computer engineering program, manufacturing engineering programs, or the mechatronics option are strongly encouraged to use LearnCoding as a preparation for COSC 121.
	- when describing this, ensure you cover the points:
		- Impact: more than CS dept + more than just learning one language. 
		- Facilitates interprogram collaboration
		- help with stduents switching from ENGR to CS
